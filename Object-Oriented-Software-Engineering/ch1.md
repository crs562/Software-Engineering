# CH 1 - Introduction to Software Engineering

## What is the purpose of modeling?

## A programming language is a notation for representing algorithms and data structures.
## List two advantages and two disadvantages of using a programming language as the sole notation throughout the development process.

## Consider a task you are not familiar with, such as designing a zero-emission car. How would you attack the problem?

## What is meant by "knowledge acquision is not sequential"? Provide a concrete example of knowledge acquisition that illustrates this.

## Hypothesize a rationale for the following design decisions:
### "The TicketDistributor will be at most one and a half meters tall."
### "The TicketDistributer will include two redundant computer systems."
### "The TicketDistributor interface will consist of a touch screen for displaying instructions and accessing commands and a single button for aborting transactions."

## Specify which of these statements are functional requirements and which are nonfunctional requirements:
### "The TicketDistributor must enable a traveler to buy weekly passes."
### "The TicketDistributor must be written in Java."
### "The TicketDistributor must be easy to use."
### "The TicketDistributor must always be available."
### "The TicketDistributor must provide a phone number to call when it fails."

## Specify which of these decision were made during requirements or system design:
### "The TicketDistributor is composed of a user interface subsystem, a subsystem for computing tariff, and a network subsystem for managing communication with the central computer."
### "The TicketDistributor hardware uses PowerPC processor chips."
### "The TicketDistributor provides the traveler with online help."

## In the following description, explain when the term account is used as an application domain concept and when as a solution domain concept:
### "Assume you are developing an online system for managing bank accounts for mobile customers. A major design issue is how to provide access to the accounts when the customer cannot establish an online connection. One proposal is that accounts are made available on the mobile computer, even if the server is not up. In this case, the accounts show the amounts from the last connected session."

## What is the difference between a task and an activity?

## A passenger aircraft is composed of several millions of parts and requires thousands of persons to assemble. A four-lane highway bridge is another example of complexity. The first version of Word for Windows, a word processor released by Microsoft in 1989, required 55 person-years, resulted into 249,000 lines of source code, and was delivered 4 years late. Aircraft and highway bridges are usually delivered on time and within budget, whereas software is often not. Discuss what are, in your opinin, the difference between developing an aircraft, a bridge, and a word processor that would cause this situation.
